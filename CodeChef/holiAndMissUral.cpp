//Problem Code: HOLIURAL
// In a far away Galaxy of Tilky Way, there was a planet Tarth where the sport of Tompetitive Toding was very popular. According to legends, there lived a setter known for making long problem statements on Holi.

// Miss Ural wants to buy colors for Holi, and that too, at the cheapest cost!!

// There are N shops selling colors near Ural's house, where the i′th shop sells colors at rate of Ri for one unit. Also, i′th shop is located at a distance of Di kilometers from her house. Life was simple, but then petrol and fuel prices soared up. The current price of petrol to travel one kilometer is K.

// Find the minimum cost at which Miss Ural can buy one unit of color. Note that she does not need to return back home.

// Input:
// The first line of input contains T, number of test cases in a file.
// The next line contains two integers, N and K, as described in the problem statement.
// The next line contains N space separated integers, denoting Di, i.e. distance of the shop.
// The next line contains N space separated integers denoting Ri, i.e. rate of the color.
// Output:
// For test case, output minimum cost to purchase 1 unit of color.

// Constraints
// 1≤T≤105
// 1≤N≤105
// Sum of N over all T in a test file does not exceed 106.
// 1≤Ri,K,Di≤109
// Subtasks
// 100% points - Original Constraints
// Sample Input:
// 2
// 3 10
// 1 2 3
// 3 2 1
// 3 1
// 2 4 6
// 3 2 1
// Sample Output:
// 13
// 5
// EXPLANATION:
// In first case, K=10. He can buy from first shop, at cost of 1∗10+3=13. Recall that the first array denotes distance.

// For second case, shop 1 offers best deal.
